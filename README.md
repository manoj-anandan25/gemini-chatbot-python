## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- A **Google AI Studio API Key** (free for testing)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
````

---

## Setup

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Create an API Key.
3. Replace the placeholder in `chatbot.py`:

```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

---

##  Run the Chatbot

Run in terminal (VS Code, PowerShell, or CMD):

```bash
python test.py
```

Sample Interaction:

```
chat with Gemin! type 'exit' to quit
You: Hello Gemini!
Gemini: Hi there! How can I help you today?
You: Tell me a fun fact
Gemini: Did you know honey never spoils? Archaeologists found 3000-year-old honey still edible!
```

##  Future Ideas

* Add **voice input/output** with `speechrecognition` + `pyttsx3`
* Save chat history to a file
* Build a web UI using Flask or Streamlit
